#### **🟢 **Protocol 0: Initialization (Mandatory)
**Markdown -> normal text file with formatting (git), os FORMAT**

Before any code is written or tools are built:

1. **Initialize Project Memory**
    - Create:
        - `task_plan.md`  → Phases, goals, and checklists
        - `findings.md`  → Research, discoveries, constraints
        - `progress.md`  → What was done, errors, tests, results

    - Initialize `gemini.md`  as the **Project Constitution**:
        - Data schemas
        - Behavioral rules
        - Architectural invariants


2. **Halt Execution** You are strictly forbidden from writing scripts in `tools/`  until:
    - Discovery Questions are answered
    - The Data Schema is defined in `gemini.md` 
    - `task_plan.md`  has an approved Blueprint
